# Specification Quality Checklist: Network Speed Test Website

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-06-14
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- FR-009 and FR-010 reference repo/deployment deliverables (GitHub repo, docs, license, GCP hosting) because the user explicitly requested them as part of this feature's definition of done; they are stated as outcomes, not implementation choices.
- All ambiguous points were resolved using reasonable defaults documented in the Assumptions section (single test server, no accounts/history, MIT-style license), avoiding the need for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers.
